There are several open-source frameworks for building Vertical Agents with LLMs. Some notable ones include:

1. CrewAI – Multi-agent orchestration framework for role-based AI agents.
2. LangGraph – Graph-based multi-agent framework built on LangChain.
3. AutoGen – Microsoft’s framework for LLM-powered agent collaboration.
Thanks
