Wave-particle duality: Imagine a particle as a tiny ball that can also act like a wave, spreading out and interfering with itself. This duality challenges our usual understanding of what particles are.\n\n2. Superposition: Picture a particle as being in multiple places at once, like a ghost that can exist in different rooms simultaneously. It's only when we look at it that it settles into one specific location.\n\n3. Quantum entanglement: Think of two particles as being like twins who are connected in a mysterious way. Whatever happens to one twin instantly affects the other, no matter how far apart they are.\n\n4. Uncertainty principle: Imagine trying to pinpoint the exact location of a moving particle while also knowing its exact speed. It's like trying to catch a butterfly in a net without scaring it away - there will always be some uncertainty.\n\n5. Quantum tunneling: Picture a particle as a tiny explorer that can magically teleport through walls or barriers instead of having to go around them.
