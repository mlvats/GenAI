## LLMs- Large Language Models : 
- A large language model is a model trained on a large amount of  text data that is capable of understanding human text and/or generating human-like text.

## Generative AI
- A generative model is one that can create new content based on data it's been trained on
  - Image generation
  - Video generation
  - Music generation
  - Text generation
 
## Input for a Language Model
- For the purposes of modern language modeling, the  smallest units of meaning in language are considered to be words (or parts of words)
- Where do words draw their meaning from? - You shall know a word by the company it keeps!

  ## Word embeddings
   - Word embeddings are a type of word representation in natural language processing (NLP) that allows computers to understand and process language more effectively by converting words into dense vectors of real numbers. These vectors capture semantic relationships between words, enabling algorithms to understand similarities, context, and meaning.
