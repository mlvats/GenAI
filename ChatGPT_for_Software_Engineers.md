# ChatGPT for Software Engineers

## You’re starting a new project.
### Three prompts you can use right after reading the requirements.
**1. Brainstorm implementation ideas**
- Use the prompt template:
    -  I need to build [explain the task’s requirements]. Should I [list the options your considering]? Explain the tradeoffs of each option.

 **2. Generate boilerplate code**      
- To build a new project from scratch, you can ask ChatGPT to create a scaffolding of the app you need,  using the technologies, frameworks and versions of your preference.
