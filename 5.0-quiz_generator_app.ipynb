Python supports multiple inheritance: True or False?\n\n### Answers:\n1. False\n2. True\n3. False\n4. True\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Python is a statically typed programming language:** False. Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime and do not need to be explicitly declared.\n   \n2. **The `print` function in Python automatically adds a newline character at the end of its output:** True. By default, the `print` function appends a newline character at the end of its output, which can be changed by setting the `end` parameter.\n\n3. **In Python, lists are immutable:** False. Lists in Python are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after the list is created.\n\n4. **Python supports multiple inheritance:** True.

What are Python decorators, and how are they used in a Python program?\n","2. Explain the concept of list comprehensions in Python and provide an example of how they can be used to create a new list.\n","\n","### Answers:\n","1. Python decorators are a powerful tool that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or class. They are functions that take another function as an argument and extend or alter its behavior. Decorators are often used for logging, access control, instrumentation, and caching. They are applied using the `@decorator_name` syntax above the function definition.\n","\n","2. List comprehensions in Python provide a concise way to create lists. They consist of an expression followed by a `for` clause, and can include additional `for` or `if` clauses. The result is a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the `for` and `if` clauses. For example, `[x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]` creates a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9, resulting in `[0, 4, 16, 36, 64]`."],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"execution_count":17,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["Markdown(quiz_response)"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"oreilly-chatgpt-apps","language":"python","name":"oreilly-chatgpt-apps"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.10"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
