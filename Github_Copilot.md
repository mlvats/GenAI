# Code Autocompletion
- write a function name to get suggestions.
- Write comment and get code suggestions. Control+Enter will give suesstions
- using Copilot and then use optioms like-  Can Fix trhe code, Can explain the code, generate documentation
- Write comment and give an example. This will give suggestions
- contril+i -> ask copilot to write code. ask copilot to write car with properties and methods
- select the code and then press control+i, ask the copilot.. refactor this function so that the code to do this in more simpler steps
- select the code and then press control+i, add "/" it gives different options ike doc, explain, fix, tests
- select the code and then press control+i, add "/test" add "use mocha" and then "use mocha and chai" and then generate test cases. See how it works. It creates a seperate file.

# Code Refactoring
- select the code and then press control+i, ask the copilot.. refactor this function so that the code to do this in more simpler steps
